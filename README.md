# Sudar — The Operating System for Learning

<p align="center">
  <strong>Learns with you, for you.</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <strong>Sudar</strong> (formerly ByteOS) is an <strong>AI-native</strong>, <strong>evidence-informed</strong> learning platform that solves the biggest problems in learning today: <br/>
  <strong>static content</strong>, <strong>one course for all</strong>, and <strong>no memory of the learner</strong>.
</p>

### What makes Sudar different

- **Sudar's longitudinal memory** — The AI tutor remembers struggles, preferences, and prior learning across sessions and courses; most "AI in LMS" is stateless.
- **Adaptive paths** — Next-best-action, struggle detection from quizzes, and optional course reordering so each learner gets a path that fits.
- **AI tutor in context** — RAG over course content plus learner memory; "Explain this" from selected text; My Memory page.
- **Compliance and certifications** — Assign paths with due dates, compliance view (overdue / at-risk / on-track), shareable certificates with verification.
- **Open source and research-backed** — MIT license; design grounded in learning sciences ([RESEARCH_FOUNDATION.md](./RESEARCH_FOUNDATION.md)). Flashcards modality and document/SCORM import in progress.

## The problem (and why it matters)

Most learning today is **static and one-size-fits-all**: the same course for every learner, no adaptation to prior knowledge or goals, and **no persistent memory of who the learner is**. Traditional LMSs track completions and scores but do not maintain a **longitudinal learner model** or offer **adaptive sequencing** and **AI tutoring with memory**. Research shows that adaptive instruction and intelligent tutoring consistently outperform fixed instruction (VanLehn, 2011; Aleven et al., 2016), yet **no widely used technology today combines learner memory, adaptive enhancement, and AI tutoring inside a single platform** that can also power — or integrate with — traditional LMS workflows. Sudar is built to be that technology: **personalised, memory-aware, and adaptive**, so every learner gets an experience that learns with them.

## About Sudar

**Sudar** is an open-source Learning Operating System built on principles from the **learning sciences** and **cognitive science**. It combines:

- **AI-powered authoring** — Create courses from prompts or documents without armies of instructional designers.
- **Adaptive delivery** — Content adapts to each learner’s goals, prior knowledge, and struggles.
- **Multi-modality** — One authoring flow; delivery in text, video, audio, mindmaps, flashcards, and games.
- **Personal AI tutor “Sudar”** — RAG-based Q&A with longitudinal memory and contextual help.
- **Learning paths & certifications** — Structured programmes with due dates, compliance, and shareable credentials.

The platform is designed so that **learners** get a personalised, supportive experience, **L&D teams** can build and assign training quickly, and **organisations** can track outcomes and compliance — all without the cost of traditional enterprise authoring tools and LMSs.

We are actively working on **bringing this same AI intelligence — learner memory and adaptive enhancement — into traditional LMS environments**, so that existing course catalogues and workflows can be personalised for every learner. There is no widely adopted technology that does this today; Sudar is built to fill that gap and is backed by the research summarised in [RESEARCH_FOUNDATION.md](./RESEARCH_FOUNDATION.md).

## Origin: from ByteAI and ByteVerse to Sudar

**Sudar** (formerly ByteOS) was created by **Dhanikesh "Dhani" Karunanithi** as the culmination of the **ByteAI** and **ByteVerse** ecosystem — a long-running line of experiments and products in AI-powered learning and authoring. Over **hundreds of variants and versions** (authoring tools, LMS prototypes, AI tutors, modality switchers, and adaptive engines), the same vision kept surfacing: learning that **remembers the learner**, **adapts in real time**, and **delivers content in the modality that fits**. Sudar is the unified system that brings that vision into one open platform: **Studio** (authoring and ops), **Learn** (learner experience), and **Intelligence** (adaptive engine and the AI tutor). It stands on the lessons of ByteAI and ByteVerse while aiming to become the reference implementation for **memory-aware, adaptive learning** that the world can use, extend, and cite.

## Updates (what we've built & what's next)

We maintain a **phase-wise development log** so every commit tells a clear story. See:

- **[UPDATES.md](./UPDATES.md)** — What we've built (Phases 1–4 complete; Phase 5 in progress: flashcards modality, document-to-course, SCORM 1.2 import), what's upcoming, and a **daily-update template** for end-of-day commits.

**Why star this repo?** Sudar is one of the few open-source platforms that combine **learner memory**, **adaptive sequencing**, and **AI tutoring** in a single stack — with a clear research foundation and a roadmap to bring this intelligence into traditional LMS workflows. Star and watch **UPDATES.md** to follow progress; we ship in phases and document each step.

---

## Sudar's memory (the differentiator)

Sudar, the AI tutor, uses **longitudinal memory**: it remembers what you've struggled with, what you know, and how you like to learn — across sessions and courses. Most "AI in LMS" implementations are stateless; Sudar is not. For how it works and where it lives in the codebase, see **[docs/sudar-memory.md](./docs/sudar-memory.md)**. A short **demo video** will be linked from **[docs/demo.md](./docs/demo.md)** once recorded.

## Screenshots

Screenshots (Learn dashboard, course viewer with Sudar, Studio paths/compliance) are in **[docs/screenshots/](./docs/screenshots/)**. Adding 2–4 screenshots there improves contributor and user confidence that Sudar is building, not just planning.

---

## Research Foundation

Sudar is grounded in established research on **adaptive instruction**, **multimodal learning**, **intelligent tutoring**, **formative assessment**, and **learner modelling**. For a concise account of the evidence base and design choices, see:

- **[RESEARCH_FOUNDATION.md](./RESEARCH_FOUNDATION.md)** — Learning sciences alignment, references, and suggested citation.

We encourage use and extension of Sudar in **academic and applied research** and ask that you cite the repository when you do.

- **Studio** — Create courses, learning paths, assign learners, set due dates, view analytics and compliance.
- **Learn** — Enrol in courses and paths, learn with Sudar, track progress, earn certificates.
- **Intelligence** — Optional Python service for heavier adaptive logic; core flows also work with direct AI calls from Studio/Learn.
