# SudarVerse App (byteverse.app) — Web Presence Updates

Apply these changes in the **byteverse-app/byteverse** repository to align the landing page with Sudar and your personal brand. Repo: https://github.com/byteverse-app/byteverse

---

## 1. Hero (`src/components/Hero.jsx`)

**Replace or update the hero text so it includes:**

- **Tagline:** "Learns with you, for you." (Sudar tagline)
- **Product line:** SudarVerse as the AI learning ecosystem **powered by Sudar** (the open-source Learning OS)
- **One line on memory/adaptation:** e.g. "The platform remembers each learner and adapts — one seed, infinite ways to learn."

**Suggested replacement block (adjust to match your JSX structure):**

```jsx
SudarVerse — Learn your way

Learns with you, for you.

Choose how you learn — text, flashcards, video, audio, or mind maps — all from the same Lesson Seed. The platform remembers each learner and adapts.

One seed. Infinite ways to learn. Powered by Sudar.

[Explore SudarVerse] [View on GitHub]
```

- **Primary CTA:** Add or make prominent a **"View on GitHub"** button linking to `https://github.com/lorddannykay/ByteOS`
- **Secondary:** Keep "Join waitlist" and/or "Watch demo" as-is.

**Bottom line in Hero (if present):** e.g. "Part of the SudarVerse Ecosystem • Powered by Sudar • Built for learners and L&D teams"

---

## 2. Features (`src/components/Features.jsx`)

**Update the `items` array to include these value props.** Add or replace so the list includes:

- **AI tutor with memory** — Sudar remembers struggles and preferences across sessions; not stateless chat.
- **Built for L&D and learners** — Author in Studio (AI course gen, paths, compliance); learn in Learn (personalised dashboard, paths, certificates).
- **Multimodal learning** — Text, flashcards, and more. One seed, switch modality anytime.
- **Lesson seed** — Align once, reuse everywhere. One source generates every modality.
- **Open & research-backed** — Open-source (Sudar), evidence-informed design. Deployed and extensible.

**Suggested `items` array (adapt to your component’s structure):**

```js
const items = [
  { title: 'AI Tutor with Memory', desc: 'Sudar remembers your struggles and preferences across sessions and courses — not stateless chat.' },
  { title: 'Built for L&D and Learners', desc: 'Author in Studio (AI course gen, paths, compliance); learn in Learn (personalised dashboard, paths, certificates).' },
  { title: 'Multimodal Learning', desc: 'Text, Flashcards, Video, Audio, and Mind Map. One seed, switch anytime; context and progress carry over.' },
  { title: 'Lesson Seed', desc: 'Align once, reuse everywhere. One source generates every modality.' },
  { title: 'Open & Research-Backed', desc: 'Powered by Sudar — open-source, evidence-informed. No vendor lock-in.' }
];
```

**Section heading (if editable):** e.g. "SudarVerse Features" with subtext: "Learning that remembers you and adapts. Choose your modality, switch anytime, stay aligned with the same Lesson Seed."

---

## 3. Footer (`src/components/Footer.jsx`)

**Add a creator/credibility line.** After the logo and links, add:

```jsx
{/* Creator & credibility */}
<p className="text-sm text-white/70 mt-4">
  By Dhanikesh Karunanithi — Global Head of Learning Tech & Data Strategy;
  2× Gold Stevie (2024), Brandon Hall Gold & Silver (2022);
  creator of the SudarAI/SudarVerse ecosystem.
</p>
```

**Ensure the GitHub link** in the footer points to `https://github.com/lorddannykay/ByteOS` (Sudar repo).

---

## 4. CTA (`src/components/CTA.jsx`)

**Add a primary CTA above or beside the waitlist form:**

- **Button/link:** "View Sudar on GitHub"
- **URL:** `https://github.com/lorddannykay/ByteOS`

**Optional headline tweak:** e.g. "Join the waitlist and be among the first to experience the complete SudarVerse ecosystem — or explore the open-source Sudar platform on GitHub today."

Keep the existing Formspree waitlist and success/error messaging.

---

## 5. README (repo root `README.md`)

**Replace the repo description and intro** so they clearly tie SudarVerse to Sudar and you:

**Suggested README intro (first 2 paragraphs):**

```markdown
# SudarVerse — AI-Powered Learning Ecosystem

SudarVerse is the AI learning ecosystem that **learns with you** — powered by [Sudar](https://github.com/lorddannykay/ByteOS), the open-source Learning Operating System. One seed. Infinite ways to learn.
