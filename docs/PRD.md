# ByteOS — Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Version**: 1.0 | **Date**: February 2026 | **Status**: Active
**Owner**: Dhani (Project Lead)
**Tagline**: *Learns with you, for you.*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

ByteOS is an AI-native Learning Operating System that democratizes high-quality, personalized
education for organizations worldwide. It replaces the fragmented ecosystem of expensive authoring
tools (Rise360, Articulate Storyline, Adobe Captivate) and legacy LMS platforms (Moodle, Cornerstone)
with a single, intelligent platform that:

1. **Enables any admin** to build world-class training content with AI — no instructional design,
   video production, or graphic design skills required.
2. **Delivers learning** to every learner in the modality that works best for *them* — text, video,
   audio, games, mindmaps, flashcards, or TikTok-style micro-content.
3. **Learns the learner** over time through a Digital Learner Twin, continuously adapting
   difficulty, pacing, and content recommendations.
4. **Gives every learner** a personal AI tutor named "Byte" — reactive, proactive, and longitudinal.

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 The Admin / L&D Team Problem

Creating professional eLearning content today requires:
- **Instructional designers** ($60,000–$100,000/year salary)
- **Authoring tool subscriptions**: Rise360 ($1,299/year), Articulate 360 ($1,299/year),
  Adobe Captivate ($1,080/year)
- **LMS subscriptions**: Cornerstone ($5–$25/user/year), Docebo ($25,000+/year),
  TalentLMS ($4–$6/user/month)
- **Video production**: $500–$5,000 per video
- **Weeks or months** to produce a single quality course

**Result**: Only well-resourced organizations can afford professional learning programs.
SMEs, startups, schools, and NGOs are left behind.

### 2.2 The Learner Problem

Even when training exists, it fails learners because:
- **One-size-fits-all**: Everyone gets the same content in the same format regardless of how
  they learn best
- **No adaptation**: Content doesn't adjust if a learner is struggling or breezing through
- **No AI help**: Learners get stuck with no one to ask — the content just sits there
- **Wrong modality**: A visual learner forced to read walls of text. An auditory learner
  sitting through silent click-through courses.
- **No continuity**: Each course is isolated — the system has no memory of who the learner is

### 2.3 The Market Gap

No single platform currently offers:
- AI-powered content creation + adaptive delivery + personalized AI tutoring
- Multi-modality content (text, video, audio, games, mindmaps) from a single source
- A Digital Learner Twin that personalizes across ALL interactions
- Accessible pricing that democratizes enterprise-grade learning

| Personalization effectiveness | Learner satisfaction score | > 4.5 / 5.0 |
| AI tutor adoption | % learners who use Byte per session | > 60% |
| Modality engagement | Avg modalities used per course | > 2 |
| Platform growth | Monthly active learners | 1,000 in month 6, 10,000 in month 12 |

### 3.2 Business Goals
- Launch free tier and paid tiers within 6 months
- Achieve 10 paying organizations within 12 months
- Maintain < $0.50 per active learner AI cost through model optimization
