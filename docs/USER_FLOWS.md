# ByteOS — User Flows & Learner Lifecycle
**Version**: 1.0 | **February 2026**

---

## Overview

This document defines every critical user flow within ByteOS across both surfaces (Studio + Learn),
plus the end-to-end learner lifecycle from signup to mastery. These flows are the source of truth
for UX design, frontend routing, and API design.

### Flow L2: Learner Dashboard (Returning User)

```
[ByteOS Learn — Dashboard]
    ├── Top row:
    │   ├── "Continue where you left off" — last active module with progress
    │   ├── Learning streak: X days 🔥
    │   └── Overdue alerts (if any)
    ├── "Byte Recommends" card:

---

### Flow L3: Starting a Course Module

```
[Learning Path Page or Course Page]
    → Click on a module
    → [Modality Selection Screen] (first time on this course)
       "How would you like to learn this?"
       ├── Text (Reading)    ← highlighted if learning profile prefers it
       ├── Video             ← badge: "Popular" if high engagement
       ├── Audio
       ├── MindMap
       ├── Flashcards

    → [Module completes OR learner exits]
    → Supabase writes: learning_events (module_start, modality)
```

---

### Flow L4: Module Experience with AI Tutor Byte

```
[Module page — any modality]

LEARNER-INITIATED:
    → Learner clicks Byte icon (bottom right)
    → [Byte sidebar opens]
       ├── Header: "Hi [Name], how can I help?"
       ├── Quick prompt suggestions: 
       │   "Explain this differently" / "Give me an example" / "Quiz me on this"
       └── Text input field
    → Learner types question
    → Byte responds (< 5 seconds, RAG against current module content)
    → Learner rates response: 👍 / 👎
    → Conversation continues or learner closes
    → Supabase writes: ai_interactions (type: question)

BYTE-INITIATED (Proactive):
    Trigger 1: 90 seconds of inactivity on a module
        → Byte expands with soft animation
        → Message: "Looks like you've been on this part for a bit — 
                    want me to explain it differently?"
        → Options: "Yes please" / "I'm good, just rereading"
        → Supabase writes: ai_interactions (type: proactive_nudge)
    
    Trigger 2: Quiz failed twice on same question
        → Byte appears: "That one's tricky. Let me try explaining it another way."
        → Byte provides alternative explanation + asks if learner wants to try again
        → Supabase writes: ai_interactions (type: proactive_nudge)
    
    Trigger 3: Modality engagement low (scroll speed too fast, replays, drop-offs)
        → Byte: "You might prefer the video version of this module —
                 learners like you often find it easier to follow."
        → Options: "Switch to video" / "I'll stay here"
        → Supabase writes: ai_interactions (type: proactive_nudge)
```

---

### Flow L5: Modality Switching Mid-Course

```
[Any module page]
    → Learner clicks modality icon in top bar
    → [Modality switcher appears]
       Shows all 7 modalities with icons
       Current modality highlighted
       "Video" or "Audio" shows "Generating..." if not yet available
    → Learner clicks a different modality
    → [Loading state] — if modality not yet generated:
       "Byte is preparing your [Video/Audio/etc.] version... (~30 seconds)"
       Background: Intelligence layer generates content variant
    → [Content reloads in new modality]
       Progress is maintained at the same logical position
    → Supabase writes: learning_events (type: modality_switch, from, to)
    → Intelligence reads this event: updates learner's modality_scores
```

---

### Flow L6: Completing a Course & Earning a Certificate

```
[Last module of a course]
    → Complete final quiz
    → [Quiz results screen]
       ├── Score: X/X correct
       ├── Pass: "🎉 You passed! Course complete."
       └── Fail: "You got X/X. You need X to pass. Try again?" / "Ask Byte for help?"
    → [Course completion screen]
       ├── Confetti animation
       ├── Certificate preview (if cert enabled)
       ├── "Share on LinkedIn" button

## SECTION 3: The Full Learner Lifecycle

```
DAY 1 — Discovery & Signup
│
├── Learner arrives (invited by org OR organic signup)
├── Creates account → Onboarding assessment
├── Digital Learner Twin initialized (modality preference, pace, difficulty)
└── First learning path appears on dashboard

WEEK 1 — First Course Experience
│
├── Takes first module in preferred modality
├── Meets Byte for the first time (proactive nudge likely in first session)
├── Completes first quiz (Byte offers help if failed)
├── Finishes first course → first certificate earned
└── Streak begins: Day 1 🔥

WEEKS 2–4 — Pattern Establishment
│
├── ByteOS Learn starts learning the learner:
│   - Detects time-of-day patterns (Daniel learns at 7am in the car)
│   - Identifies modality affinity (Marcus loves video + game)
│   - Finds knowledge gaps (Amara struggles with data concepts)
├── Byte becomes more personalized — references past interactions
├── Modality auto-selection gets smarter with each session
└── Dashboard starts showing "Your skill progress" with real data

MONTH 2 — Deepening Engagement
│
├── Learner is now 3–5 courses in
├── ByteMind mindmap shows connected knowledge graph
├── Byte remembers: "Last time you asked about X — here's how it connects to today's topic"
├── Next Best Action gets highly accurate (based on 20+ sessions of data)
├── Skills graph shows measurable progress
└── Second certificate earned → shared on LinkedIn → new learners discover ByteOS

MONTH 3–6 — Mastery & Achievement
│
├── Learning path completed → full path certificate
├── Skill proficiency: visible jump in skill domains
├── Learner becomes an advocate → invites colleagues
├── Admin notices learner's completion rate + skill data → showcases in team meeting
└── Learner sets a new goal → new path begins

ONGOING — The Compounding Effect
│
├── Digital Learner Twin is rich with 6+ months of data
├── Every new course is immediately personalized from session 1
├── Byte knows: preferred modality, optimal session length, time-of-day, knowledge gaps
├── Learner can't imagine using a platform that doesn't know them
└── Switching cost is the data — the longer you use ByteOS, the more personal it gets
```

    Dashboard personalization increases
    Byte gets smarter about this learner
                ↓
[STUDIO: Admin sees results]
