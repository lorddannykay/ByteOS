# ByteOS — Strategic Path to the Ultimate Goal

**Document purpose**: Align all development toward the single vision and provide a clear, executable roadmap.  
**Ultimate goal**: *ByteOS is the world's first AI-native Learning Operating System that learns the learner and adapts modality, pace, difficulty, and content in real time.*  
**Tagline**: *Learns with you, for you.*

## 1. Vision Alignment — How Every Development Ladders Up

| Strategic pillar | What it means | How we measure progress |
|------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **Learns the learner** | Byte and the platform accumulate signals (goals, struggles, preferences, behavior) and use them to personalize content, order, and recommendations. | Learner profile richness, next best action accuracy, adaptive path ordering, tutor memory usage. |
| **Author once, deliver any modality** | Content is authored once in Studio; Learn can present it as text, video, audio, mindmap, flashcards, feed, or game. | Number of modalities live, content reuse across modalities, learner modality switches. |
| **Democratize creation** | L&D can build world-class training without armies of designers; AI and simple UX do the heavy lifting. | Time-to-course, source inputs (doc/URL/prompt), template usage, zero-code flows. |
| **Outcomes and compliance** | Organizations see completions, skill gaps, and risk; mandatory training and certifications are tracked and attested. | Analytics usage, path assignments, due dates, certificates, compliance views. |

Every new feature or fix should map to at least one of these pillars. If it doesn’t, defer it.

## 2. Current State (As of This Document)

**Done and live**  
- **Foundation**: Supabase schema, shared auth, Studio + Learn scaffold, env contracts.  
- **Integration**: Course CRUD, publish → Learn, enrollments, learning_events, progress.  
- **Learner experience**: Personalized dashboard (streak, time, engagement, Byte recommends), course viewer with markdown, quizzes, AI tutor Byte (RAG + longitudinal memory), My Memory page, onboarding assessment, text selection → Byte.  
- **Intelligence**: Next best action engine, onboarding bootstrap, learner_profiles + ai_tutor_context, struggle detection from quizzes, adaptive path ordering (optional courses reordered by Byte).  
- **Paths & certs**: Learning paths (Studio: create/edit, mandatory/adaptive/certificate toggles; Learn: enroll, personalised sequence, progress sync), path unlock rules (complete previous first), certifications on path completion with shareable public link.  
- **Studio analytics**: Org-level analytics (completions, quiz scores, struggle topics).  
- **Progress**: Dedicated Progress page (courses, paths, certificates), path progress % sync on course complete.

**Recently added (Action Plans A–C)**  
- **Creator velocity**: Assign path to learners from Studio path editor (org members list + optional due date); “Assigned learners” table with progress and due date.  
- **Learner polish**: Certificate page has reliable “Print / Save as PDF” (client component + print CSS); Learn dashboard shows “Upcoming deadlines” and “Required by your organisation” when relevant.  
- **Compliance**: Studio “Compliance” page lists path assignments with due date, progress, and status (Overdue / At risk / On track / Completed); Learn dashboard surfaces required paths and due-soon items.

**Remaining gaps vs. ultimate goal**  
- **Creator velocity**: No document/URL import or RAG-from-docs yet.  
- **Modality**: Only text is live; Video/Audio/MindMap/Flashcards/Feed/Play are placeholders.  
- **Compliance**: No email reminders for at-risk/overdue yet.  
- **Polish**: No server-generated certificate PDF.  
- **Scale**: No white-label, SSO, or HRIS hooks yet (explicitly later phase).

## 3. Prioritized Next Developments (In Order)

Priorities are chosen to maximise progress toward the four pillars without overbuilding.

1. **Creator velocity (Studio)**  
   - Assign learning path to learners (and optionally set due date).  
   - Show due dates and “at-risk” on Analytics or a simple compliance view.  
   - *Why first*: Drives real usage of paths and certifications; aligns with “outcomes and compliance”.

2. **Learner polish (Learn)**  
   - Certificate page: reliable “Print / Save as PDF” (browser print + optional instructions).  
   - Dashboard/Progress: surface “Upcoming deadlines” when enrollments have due_date.  
   - *Why second*: Improves perceived quality and urgency without new backend services.

3. **Compliance & visibility (Studio + Learn)**  
   - Studio: Compliance view — list path/course enrollments with due_date, status (on track / at-risk / overdue).  
   - Learn: “Required” or “Due soon” on dashboard for assigned paths/courses with due dates.  
   - *Why third*: Makes “outcomes and compliance” visible and actionable.

4. **Second modality (Learn)**  
   - Ship one non-text modality end-to-end (e.g. Flashcards from module content or Audio TTS for current module).  
   - *Why fourth*: Proves “author once, deliver any modality” with minimal scope.

5. **Document/URL import (Studio)**  
   - Upload PDF/DOCX or paste URL; extract text; optional RAG for course generation.  
   - *Why fifth*: Big win for “democratize creation” but larger scope; after core flows are solid.

6. **Further modalities and scale**  
   - BytePlay, ByteFeed, ByteMind, then white-label/SSO/HRIS as in ECOSYSTEM Phase 5.  
   - *Why last*: Higher effort and dependency; follow once 1–5 are in place.

## 4. Strategic Principles for Execution

- **Solo builder**: Prefer the simplest implementation that meets the pillar; avoid over-engineering.  
- **Data first**: Use existing schema (e.g. `enrollments.due_date`, `learning_paths`) before adding new tables.  
- **One surface at a time**: Finish a full flow on one app (e.g. Studio assign + due date) before spreading to the other.  
- **Agents**: Use multiple agents for independent workstreams (e.g. Studio vs Learn) when tasks are clearly scoped and non-overlapping.  
- **Definition of done**: Each task ends with “working in UI + no regressions” and, if applicable, a one-line note in CHANGELOG or this doc.

## 5. How This Document Is Used

- **Before starting work**: Read Section 1 (vision) and Section 3 (priorities). Confirm the task maps to a pillar and a priority.  
- **Planning**: Use `docs/ACTION_PLANS.md` for concrete tasks, owners, and order.  
- **Review**: After each sprint or plan, update Section 2 (current state) and adjust Section 3 if priorities change.  
- **Onboarding**: New contributors or agents read ECOSYSTEM.md → AGENTS.md → this file → ACTION_PLANS.md.
