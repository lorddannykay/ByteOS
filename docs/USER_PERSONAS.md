# ByteOS — User Personas
**Version**: 1.0 | **February 2026**

---

## Overview

ByteOS serves two primary user types across two surfaces:
- **Admins / Creators** → use ByteOS Studio
- **Learners** → use ByteOS Learn

Within each type, there are distinct personas with unique contexts, goals, and pain points.
Every feature decision should be tested against at least one of these personas.

## ADMIN / CREATOR PERSONAS

---

### Persona A1 — "The Overwhelmed L&D Manager"
**Name**: Sarah Okafor
**Age**: 34
**Role**: Learning & Development Manager
**Company**: 450-person retail company (Segment: SME)
**Location**: Manchester, UK

**Context**:
Sarah is a team of one. She manages all training for 450 retail staff — compliance, product
knowledge, onboarding, soft skills. She has a small budget, no instructional designers, and
is expected to deliver "professional" training that actually works.

She currently uses Google Slides + a free Moodle instance. She's tried Rise360 but it takes
her days to produce one module and the result is "just okay."

**Goals**:
- Produce compliance training quickly and prove employees completed it
- Create engaging onboarding for new hires (30% monthly staff turnover)
- Track who's completed what without chasing people manually
- Look competent to her senior leadership team

**Pain Points**:
- Creating content takes 2–3 days per course. She doesn't have that time.
- Completion rates are terrible (< 20%). "People just click through."
- No analytics — she manually tracks completions in a spreadsheet
- She cannot afford Rise360 ($1,299/year) on top of Moodle fees
- Senior leadership asks for "more engaging" training with no extra budget

**How She Uses ByteOS**:
- Uploads the compliance policy PDF on Monday morning
- ByteOS Studio generates a 5-module course in 12 minutes
- She reviews, adjusts the template to match company branding, and publishes
- Assigns the course to all retail staff with a 2-week deadline
- Checks the compliance dashboard on Friday — 67% done, 8 people overdue
- Sends automated reminders from Studio with one click

**Quote**:
> "I don't need a platform that makes me feel like an instructional designer.
> I need one that makes me look like one."

**Success State**: A compliance course built, published, and 90% completed in one week,
with zero chasing.

### Persona A2 — "The Expert Who Can't Teach"
**Name**: Dr. James Oduya
**Age**: 48
**Role**: Senior Medical Officer (Subject Matter Expert)
**Company**: Regional hospital network (Segment: Healthcare education)
**Location**: Lagos, Nigeria

**Context**:
James has 20 years of clinical expertise. His hospital network needs to train 300 nurses and
junior doctors on new patient safety protocols. He knows the content deeply but has never
built a course. He has no design skills, no video equipment, and limited tech savvy.

His only alternative is hiring an external training company — which costs $15,000 per program.

**Goals**:
- Turn his clinical expertise into training that protects patients
- Reach all staff across 5 locations without in-person sessions
- Ensure staff can be certified as having received the training

**Pain Points**:
- Traditional course tools are too complex for a non-designer
- He has no idea how to make a video or an "interactive" course
- External training companies are unaffordable
- He writes detailed documents but needs them to become engaging courses

**How He Uses ByteOS**:
- Uploads his 40-page patient safety protocol document
- ByteOS Studio reads it and generates a 6-module course with medical accuracy checks
- He reviews the quiz questions, adds 2 clinical photos from his own files
- Publishes the course; nurses complete it on their phones between shifts
- Byte (AI tutor) answers nurses' clinical questions in context, citing the protocol

**Quote**:
> "My expertise was sitting in documents nobody read. Now it's a course that 300 nurses
> have completed. I didn't touch a design tool once."

**Success State**: Expert knowledge converted to training, consumed by 300 staff,
with full certification records — zero design or tech skills required.

### Persona A3 — "The Forward-Thinking HR Leader"
**Name**: Priya Krishnamurthy
**Age**: 41
**Role**: VP of People Operations
**Company**: 1,200-person SaaS company (Segment: Mid-market tech)
**Location**: Sydney, Australia

**Context**:
Priya oversees L&D as part of a larger People Ops function. Her company has a $200K annual
L&D budget and currently uses Docebo LMS + Articulate 360 with 2 instructional designers.

She's unhappy with the ROI. Completion rates are 35%. Skills are not measurably improving.
The board is asking her to prove learning investment creates business outcomes.

**Goals**:
- Connect training to measurable business outcomes (sales performance, NPS, retention)
- Scale learning without scaling headcount (IDs are expensive)
- Demonstrate skill development to leadership
- Build a culture of continuous learning

**Pain Points**:
- Current stack ($40K+/year) doesn't give her skill-level data — only completions
- Instructional designers take 6 weeks to produce one course
- Cannot personalize at scale — every employee gets the same training
- No AI capabilities in current stack

**How She Uses ByteOS**:
- Migrates her content library into ByteOS Studio
- Sets up skills framework aligned to her company's competency model
- Creates learning paths for each role with compliance requirements
- Monitors the org-wide skill gap heatmap to inform hiring and development plans
- Presents quarterly learning ROI to the board: skill uplift mapped to performance data

**Quote**:
> "For the first time, I can show the board that the $200K we spent on learning
> actually moved the needle on skills. ByteOS is the evidence I needed."

**Success State**: L&D is no longer a cost center — it's a measurable driver of business
performance with data to prove it.

## LEARNER PERSONAS

---

### Persona L1 — "The Reluctant Completer"
**Name**: Marcus Adeyemi
**Age**: 27
**Role**: Store Team Leader
**Company**: Retail chain (assigned learner)
**Location**: Lagos, Nigeria
**Device**: Primarily mobile (Android)

**Context**:
Marcus has been assigned compliance training. He sees it as a box-ticking exercise.
He's tried to get through it on his lunch break but it's 47 boring slides with tiny text
and he can't remember what he read by the time he hits the quiz.

He learns best by doing and watching — reading walls of text is not how his brain works.

**Goals**:
- Complete the required training without losing his mind
- Actually remember something useful from it
- Pass the quiz first time

**Pain Points**:
- Text-heavy courses on a small phone screen
- No help when he doesn't understand something
- Feels like the training doesn't see him as an individual
- "It's the same course everyone else gets"

**How He Uses ByteOS Learn**:
- Onboarding assessment reveals he's a visual/kinaesthetic learner
- ByteOS auto-selects the Video modality for his first module
- He watches a 3-minute narrated video on his commute home
- Gets stuck on a concept → asks Byte: "Can you explain what 'risk mitigation' means here?"
- Byte responds in plain language with an example from Marcus's retail context
- Switches to BytePlay for module 4 — plays a safety hazard spotting game
- Finishes the course, earns his certificate, shares it on LinkedIn

**Quote**:
> "That's the first compliance course I've actually finished. And I remember what it taught me."

**Success State**: Course completed, knowledge retained, certificate earned —
and Marcus looks forward to the next one.

### Persona L2 — "The Self-Directed Climber"
**Name**: Amara Diallo
**Age**: 30
**Role**: Junior Marketing Analyst
**Company**: Fintech startup (self-enrolled)
**Location**: Accra, Ghana
**Device**: Mix of laptop (work) and mobile (evenings)

**Context**:
Amara is ambitious. She wants to move into a Marketing Manager role within 18 months.
She's using ByteOS on her own initiative — not because she was assigned a course, but
because she identified a skill gap (data analytics, presentation skills, leadership fundamentals)
and is filling it systematically.

She learns best by reading and mindmaps — she loves seeing how concepts connect.

**Goals**:
- Build the skills to be promotable to Manager level
- Learn efficiently around a full-time job (evenings and weekends)
- Build a credentialed portfolio of completed training

**Pain Points**:
- Generic courses don't map to her specific career goal
- Hard to know "what to learn next" — too many options, unclear sequencing
- Doesn't want to spend money on multiple subscriptions
- Standard LMS courses are written for Americans — limited global relevance

**How She Uses ByteOS Learn**:
- Sets a goal: "Become a Marketing Manager in 18 months"
- ByteOS Intelligence suggests a learning path: Data Analytics → Business Communication →
  Leadership Essentials → Marketing Strategy
- Amara works through the path at her own pace
- Uses MindMap modality to visualize how concepts connect before digging into text
- Byte remembers she finds data concepts difficult — proactively asks if she'd like
  extra examples when she reaches analytics modules
- After 6 weeks: 3 certifications, visible skill progress, personal confidence boost

**Quote**:
> "ByteOS figured out what I needed to learn before I did. And it actually explains
> things the way my brain works."

**Success State**: A clear, AI-guided path to her career goal, with measurable progress
and credentials she's proud to share.

### Persona L3 — "The On-the-Go Professional"
**Name**: Daniel Mensah
**Age**: 43
**Role**: Regional Sales Director
**Company**: Pharmaceutical company (assigned + self-enrolled)
**Location**: Nairobi, Kenya → frequently traveling
**Device**: iPhone, primarily

**Context**:
Daniel is busy and distracted. He's in meetings 70% of the day and commutes 2 hours daily.
He has mandatory product knowledge training assigned and genuinely wants to be current on
new pharmaceutical research — but has almost no time at a desk.

He learns best by listening — podcasts and audiobooks are how he consumes all his content.

**Goals**:
- Complete mandatory training without falling behind
- Stay current on new product knowledge
- Learn during his commute without looking at a screen

**Pain Points**:
- All corporate training requires sitting at a laptop — impossible with his schedule
- Video courses require him to actually watch — he can't do this while driving
- He can't read long documents on his phone while commuting

**How He Uses ByteOS Learn**:
- Opens ByteOS Learn on his iPhone at 7am before his drive
- Byte recommends: "You have 3 overdue modules — want me to play them as audio?"
- Daniel taps Audio modality — his phone plays a podcast-style narration for 45 minutes
- Bluetooth in his car handles playback; transcript auto-syncs in the background
- At red lights, Daniel asks Byte a quick question by voice (future: voice input)
- In the evening: 10 minutes of Flashcards to reinforce what he heard that morning

**Quote**:
> "I've completed more training in the last month than in the previous year.
> Because it works the way I live."

**Success State**: Zero overdue training, full product knowledge, and all learning
happens during time he previously considered "dead" — his commute.

### Persona L4 — "The Student / Emerging Talent"
**Name**: Fatima Al-Hassan
**Age**: 22
**Role**: Final-year business student / part-time intern
**Company**: N/A (individual learner, free tier)
**Location**: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
**Device**: Mobile and laptop

**Context**:
Fatima is preparing for her first full-time job. She's heard of ByteOS through LinkedIn and
is using the free tier to upskill in Excel, project management, and professional communication
before job applications.

She's a digital native — she learns through short-form video and interactive content.
Long articles and traditional eLearning feel like a chore.

**Goals**:
- Build employability skills before graduating
- Earn credentials she can put on her LinkedIn profile
- Learn affordably (she's a student with no income)

**Pain Points**:
- Most quality training is expensive ($20–$50/course on Coursera, Udemy)
- She can't focus on long-form content
- Generic courses assume she has work experience she doesn't have

**How She Uses ByteOS Learn**:
- Signs up for free tier
- Onboarding shows she's an "active, visual" learner
- Starts with ByteFeed modality — micro-content cards she can consume in 5-minute bursts
- Switches to BytePlay for Excel functions — the game makes it click in a way reading didn't
- Earns 3 free tier certificates, shares on LinkedIn
- Gets a premium trial offer — converts to paid with first paycheck

**Quote**:
> "I learned more Excel in 2 hours on ByteOS than in 6 weeks of university lectures.
> And the certificate actually looks good on my LinkedIn."

**Success State**: Employed with a demonstrable skill portfolio, ByteOS was part of her
journey from student to professional.
