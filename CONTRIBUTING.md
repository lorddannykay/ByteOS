# Contributing to ByteOS

Thank you for your interest in ByteOS. We aim to keep the project aligned with **evidence-informed learning** and **democratising high-quality education**.

## Before You Start

1. **Read the context**
   - [ECOSYSTEM.md](./ECOSYSTEM.md) — Architecture, schema, and product philosophy.
   - [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) — Conventions and patterns (useful for humans too).
   - [RESEARCH_FOUNDATION.md](./RESEARCH_FOUNDATION.md) — Learning sciences alignment.

2. **Check the roadmap**
   - [docs/STRATEGIC_PATH.md](./docs/STRATEGIC_PATH.md) and [docs/ACTION_PLANS.md](./docs/ACTION_PLANS.md) describe priorities and in-progress work.

## How to Contribute

- **Bug reports and feature ideas** — Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/lorddannykay/ByteOS/issues).
- **Code and docs** — Fork the repo, create a branch, make your changes, and open a Pull Request.

## Guidelines

- **Learner-first** — Features should improve the learner’s experience or the ability of admins to support learners.
- **Simplicity** — Prefer the smallest change that achieves the goal (solo-builder friendly).
- **Data and privacy** — Don’t add tracking or data use that isn’t in the spirit of “learning the learner” for the learner’s benefit.
