# ByteOS — Updates & Development Log

**Creator:** Dhanikesh "Dhani" Karunanithi · **Ecosystem:** ByteAI & ByteVerse → ByteOS

This file tracks **what we've built** (phase-wise) and **what's upcoming**. Update it at the end of each development day so every GitHub commit tells a clear story. Use the format below for new entries.

---

## How to use this file

- **When you commit**: Add a short dated entry under **Latest** with the day’s changes, then commit with a message that references the update (e.g. `Updates: path assignment + compliance view (UPDATES.md)`).
- **What we've built**: Summary of completed phases (update when a phase or major feature is done).
- **What's upcoming**: Prioritised next work (sync with [docs/STRATEGIC_PATH.md](docs/STRATEGIC_PATH.md) and [docs/ACTION_PLANS.md](docs/ACTION_PLANS.md)).

## Latest (add new entries at the top)

### 2026-02-26
- **Repo & docs**: ByteOS pushed to GitHub with README, RESEARCH_FOUNDATION, UPDATES, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE. Creator story and problem/solution framing added; research-backed positioning for adaptive learning + learner memory.
- **Phase summary**: UPDATES.md created; phase-wise “what we’ve built” and “what’s upcoming” documented for daily commits.

### 2026-02-24 (representative)
- **Compliance & creator velocity**: Path assignment from Studio (assign learners + due date), Assigned learners table, Compliance page (overdue / at-risk / on-track). Learn: Upcoming deadlines, Required by organisation, Certificate Print/Save as PDF.
- **Progress & paths**: Progress page (courses, paths, certificates), path progress % sync on course complete, path unlock rules (complete previous first).

## What we've built (phase-wise)

### Phase 1 — Foundation ✅
- Supabase schema (profiles, organisations, courses, modules, enrollments, learning_events, ai_interactions, learner_profiles, learning_paths, certifications).
- Shared auth (Supabase Auth) across Studio and Learn.
- ByteOS Studio scaffold (Next.js 14): dashboard, courses CRUD, org/workspace.
- ByteOS Learn scaffold (Next.js 14): dashboard, course catalog, enrollments.
- Environment contracts and RLS policies.

### Phase 2 — Integration ✅
- Course publish: Studio publishes to Supabase; Learn reads and displays published courses.
- Enrollments and learning_events (module start/complete, quiz attempts, duration).
- Progress calculation and enrollment status (not_started, in_progress, completed).
- End-to-end flow: author → publish → enroll → learn → track.

### Phase 3 — Learner experience ✅
- **Personalised dashboard**: Streak, total learning time, engagement %, courses completed, “Byte recommends” (next best action).
- **Course viewer**: Markdown rendering, module navigation, progress auto-save, quizzes with immediate feedback.
- **AI tutor “Byte”**: RAG over full course content, longitudinal memory (ai_interactions + ai_tutor_context), contextual “Explain this” from text selection, My Memory page (view/edit what Byte knows).
- **Onboarding assessment**: Short intake flow to bootstrap learner profile (goals, background, style).
- **Learning paths**: Enroll in paths, personalised sequence for adaptive paths, path progress and unlock rules (complete previous first).
- **Certifications**: Auto-issued on path completion, shareable public verification link, Print/Save as PDF.
- **Progress page**: Single view for courses, paths, and certificates.
- **Upcoming deadlines** and **Required by your organisation** on dashboard.

### Phase 4 — Intelligence ✅
- **Next best action**: Scores unenrolled courses from learner profile, AI-generated reason, stored in learner_profiles.
- **Struggle detection**: Quiz wrong answers feed into ai_tutor_context.struggles_with; used for path ordering and tutor context.
- **Adaptive path ordering**: Optional courses in a path reordered per learner (Byte surfaces gaps, deprioritises known concepts).
- **Personalised welcome**: On enrollment in adaptive courses, AI-generated welcome that connects prior learning to the new course.
- **Studio analytics**: Org-level completions, quiz scores, top struggle topics; **Compliance** view (overdue / at-risk / on-track).
- **Path assignment**: Assign path to learners from Studio, optional due date, “Assigned learners” table.

### Phase 5 — Scale (in progress)
- **Done**: Path assignment + due dates, compliance view, certificate print, upcoming deadlines, required paths.
- **Upcoming**: Second modality (e.g. Flashcards or Audio), document/URL import for authoring, email reminders for at-risk/overdue, then BytePlay/ByteFeed/ByteMind, white-label, SSO/HRIS.
